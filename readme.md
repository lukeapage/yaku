# Overview

Yaku is full compatible with ES6's native [Promise][native], but much faster, and more error friendly.
If you want to learn how Promise works, read the minimum implementation [yaku.aplus][]. Without comments, it is only 80 lines of code (gzipped size is KB).
It only implements the `constructor` and `then`.

Yaku passed all the tests of [promises-aplus-tests][], [promises-es6-tests][], and even the [core-js tests][].

I am not an optimization freak, I try to keep the source code readable and maintainable.
I write this lib to research one of my data structure ideas: [docs/lazyTree.md][].

# Features

- One of the best for mobile, gzipped file is only 1.9KB
- Supports "uncaught rejection" and "long stack trace", [Comparison][docs/debugHelperComparison.md]
- Works on IE5+ and other major browsers
- 100% statement and branch test coverage
- Better CPU and memory performance than the native Promise
- Well commented source code with every Promises/A+ spec
- Highly modularized extra helpers, no pollution to its pure ES6 implements
- Supports ES7 `finally`



# Quick Start

## Node.js

```shell
npm install yaku
```

Then:

```js
var Promise = require('yaku');
```

Or if you don't want any extra debug helper, ES6 only version is here:

```js
var Promise = require('yaku/lib/yaku.core');
```

Or if you only want aplus support:

```js
var Promise = require('yaku/lib/yaku.aplus');
```

## Browser

Raw usage:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysmood/yaku/master/src/yaku.js"></script>
<script>
    // Yaku will be assigned to `window.Yaku`.
    var Promise = Yaku;
</script>
```

# Compare to Other Promise Libs

These comparisons only reflect some limited truth, no one is better than all others on all aspects.
There are tons of Promises/A+ implementations, you can see them [here](https://promisesaplus.com/implementations). Only some of the famous ones were tested.

- **unit test**: [promises-aplus-tests][], [promises-es6-tests][], and even the [core-js tests][].

- **coverage**: statement coverage and branch coverage.

- **helpers**: extra methods that help with your promise programming, such as
  async flow control helpers, debug helpers. For more details: [docs/debugHelperComparison.md][].

- **1ms async task**: `npm run no -- benchmark`, the smaller the better (total time / memory rss).

- **promises-es6-tests**: If you want to test `bluebird` against promises-es6-tests,
  run `npm run no -- test-es6 --shim bluebird`.

- **optional helpers**: Whether the helpers can be imported separately or not,
  which means you can load the lib without helpers. Such as the `bluebird-core`, it will inevitably load
  some nonstandard helpers: `spread`, `promisify`, etc.


# FAQ

- `catch` on old browsers (IE7, IE8 etc)?

  > In ECMA-262 spec, `catch` cannot be used as method name. You have to alias the method name or use something like `Promise.resolve()['catch'](function() {})` or `Promise.resolve().then(null, function() {})`.

- When using with Babel and Regenerator, the unhandled rejection doesn't work.

  > Because Regenerator use global Promise directly and don't have an api to set the Promise lib.
  > You have to import Yaku globally to make it use Yaku: `require("yaku/lib/global");`.


# Unhandled Rejection

Yaku will report any unhandled rejection via `console.error` by default, in case you forget to write `catch`.
You can catch them manually:

- Browser: `window.onunhandledrejection = ({ promise, reason }) => { /* Your Code */ };`
- Node: `process.on("unhandledRejection", (reason, promise) => { /* Your Code */ });`

For more spec read [Unhandled Rejection Tracking Browser Events](https://github.com/domenic/unhandled-rejections-browser-spec).


# API

- #### require('yaku')


- #### require('yaku/lib/utils') or any of them like require('yaku/lib/retry')


- #### require('yaku/lib/Observable')


---------------------------------------






# Utils

It's a bundle of all the following functions. You can require them all with `var yutils = require("yaku/lib/utils")`,
or require them separately like `require("yaku/lib/flow")`. If you want to use it in the browser, you have to use `browserify` or `webpack`. You can even use another Promise lib, such as:

```js
require("yaku/lib/_").Promise = require("bluebird");
var source = require("yaku/lib/source");

// now "source" use bluebird instead of yaku.
```




# Observable





# Unit Test

This project use [promises-aplus-tests][] to test the compliance of Promises/A+ specification. There are about 900 test cases.

Use `npm run no -- test` to run the unit test against yaku.

## Test other libs

### basic test

To test `bluebird`: `npm run no -- test-basic --shim bluebird`

The `bluebird` can be replaced with other lib, see the `test/getPromise.js` for which libs are supported.

### aplus test

To test `bluebird`: `npm run no -- test-aplus --shim bluebird`

The `bluebird` can be replaced with other lib, see the `test/getPromise.js` for which libs are supported.

### es6 test

To test `bluebird`: `npm run no -- test-es6 --shim bluebird`

The `bluebird` can be replaced with other lib, see the `test/getPromise.js` for which libs are supported.


# Benchmark

Use `npm run no -- benchmark` to run the benchmark.

# Contribution

Make sure you have `npm` and `npm install` at the root of the project first.

Other than use `gulp`, all my projects use [nokit][] to deal with automation.
Run `npm run no -- -h` to print all the tasks that you can use.

## Update `readme.md`

Please don't alter the `readme.md` directly, it is compiled from the `docs/readme.jst.md`.
Edit the `docs/readme.jst.md` and execute `npm run no` to rebuild the project.
